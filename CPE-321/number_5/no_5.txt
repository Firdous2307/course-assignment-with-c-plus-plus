Files:
- proximity_sensor.cpp: The main C++ source code file containing the program logic.

Functions:
1. int readProximityData()
   - Returns: An integer representing the proximity value (0 to 100).

2. void updateDisplay(int proximityValue)
   - Parameters:
     - proximityValue: An integer representing the proximity value to be displayed.

3. int main()
- Steps:
     - Initializes the random number generator.
     - Enters a loop to continuously read proximity data and update the display.
     - Inside the loop:
       - Reads proximity data using readProximityData().
       - Updates the display using updateDisplay().
       - Adds a delay before the next iteration.
   - Returns: 0 upon successful completion.

Notes:
- This program is a simple demonstration and does not interface with real hardware.
- Adjustments may be required to interface with actual proximity sensors and display modules.
